## # `EAX` -

Registers EAX usually ==stores results of functions calls,operations and comparisons==.Jumps are often based on the results stored in EAX.

## # `ESP` -

It stands for Extended Stack Pointer.It always ==point to the memory address of the top of the stack== ; stack pointer used to point to the last item on the stack.

## # `EBP` -

It stands for Extended Base Pointer.It points to the base pointer.By accessing EBP, a function can easily reference information from its stack frame (via offsets) while executing.

## # `EIP` -

EIP, the instruction pointer, is one of the most important registers as it always points to the next code instruction to be executed.It stands for the Extended Instruction Pointer.It ==points to the next instruction to execute==.

## # `ECX` -

Counter register; commonly used for looping.

## # `Assembly Instructions` -

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">NOP</mark>

It stands for No operation(x90).

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Push</mark>

It moves a word/Dword/Qword or register(not EIP) onto the stack.

```
Push EAX
```

Pushes the value stored in EAX onto the stack.

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Pop</mark>

Removes a Dword off the stack and puts it in a register.

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Call</mark>

Transfers control to a different function.

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Move</mark>

It moves data from one location to another.

```
mov destination,source
```

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Cmp</mark>

It compares two operation.

```
cmp eax,edx
```

compare value of edx with eax if equal set the zero flag to 1.

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">EAX Vs [EAX]</mark> -

`EAX` refers to the actual register, while `[EAX]` refers to the memory location pointed to by the value in the `EAX` register.

- Sub

```bash
sub eax, edx
```

For example, if the value in `eax` is 10 and the value in `edx` is 3, then after executing the instruction `sub eax, edx`, the value in `eax` will become 7 and then stores the result in `eax`.

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Jmp</mark>

Jmp instruction performs an unconditional jump, moves control to absolute or relative address.

### ## <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Processor Flags</mark> -

The x86 processors have a large set of flags that represent the state of the processor, and the conditional jump instructions can key off of them in combination.

- CF - carry flag

Set on high-order bit carry or borrow; cleared otherwise

- PF - parity flag

Set if low-order eight bits of result contain an even number of "1" bits; cleared otherwise

- ZF - zero flags

Set if result is zero; cleared otherwise

- SF - sign flag

Set equal to high-order bit of result (0 if positive 1 if negative)

- OF - overflow flag

Set if result is too large a positive number or too small a negative number (excluding sign bit) to fit in destination operand; cleared otherwise

## # `Calling Convention` -

A calling convention is a set of rules for how function calls are made and how arguments are passed between a caller and a callee. The calling convention ==defines the order in which arguments are passed, how they are passed (in registers, on the stack, or both), and who is responsible for cleaning up the stack after the function returns.==

There are several different calling conventions, including:

1.  <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Standard Calling Convention (CDECL):</mark> This convention is used in the C programming language and some other languages. It specifies that arguments are passed on the stack from right to left, ==the return value is placed in EAX== and the caller is responsible for cleaning up the stack after the function returns.

Example -

```c
push              edx ; Substr
push              eax ; Str
call              strstr
add               esp, 8       [Add cleansup the stack two push means two arguments were pushed so we add 8(one push is 4 byte)]
```

In the above add cleans up the stack.

2. <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Stdcall:</mark> It is similar to cdecl but the callee cleans up the stack.==This is the convention used in WIN32 APIs.== 

Example -

```c
push            offset LibFileName ; "kernel32.dll"
call            ds:LoadLibraryA
mov             [ebp+hModule], eax
```

In the above no stack cleanup after call.

3. <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Fastcall:</mark> This convention is used on some x86-based platforms, and it specifies that ==the first two arguments are passed in registers, with any additional arguments passed on the stack==.In the fastcall convention, the callee is responsible for cleaning up the stack. However, since the first two arguments are passed in registers, there is usually no need to clean up the stack.

Example -

```c
mov           edx, offset aCmdExe ; "cmd.exe"
lea           ecx, [ebp+8]
call          sub_409008
```

In this example, the first function call (sub_409008) is made with the fastcall convention. In this case, the EDX and ECX registers are used, and there is no stack cleanup

4. <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Microsoft x64 calling convention:</mark> This convention is used on Windows x64 systems. It specifies that ==the first four integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers, with any additional arguments passed on the stack==.In the Microsoft x64 calling convention, the the callee (the function being called) is responsible for cleaning up the stack after the function returns.

---

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">For Windows 64bit architecture :</mark>

In 64-bit Windows, the default calling convention for C and C++ functions is the Microsoft x64 calling convention.The Microsoft x64 calling convention specifies the rules for how function arguments are passed to and returned from functions, as well as how the stack is managed during function calls.

- ==The first four integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers (RCX, RDX, R8, and R9)==.
- Additional integer or pointer arguments are passed on the stack in right-to-left order.
- The ==stack is aligned to a 16-byte boundary== at function entry.

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">For Windows 32bit architectue :</mark> 

In 32-bit Windows, the default calling convention for C and C++ functions is the Microsoft x86 calling convention, which is also known as the `cdecl` convention.

- ==Arguments are passed on the stack in right-to-left order.==
- The ==stack is aligned to a 4-byte boundary== at function entry.

## # `Right-to-Left Parameter Order` -

The phenomenon of ==pushing parameters in reverse order== is called "right-to-left parameter order". In this convention, ==the rightmost parameter is pushed onto the stack first, followed by the parameter to its left, and so on==. This convention is used in many assembly languages and calling conventions, including the x86 and x86-64 architectures.

Example -

MessageBox which is a windows api takes 4 parameter and has structure like below in assembly -
[MessageBox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messagebox)

--- MessageBox ---

push 0                              [ Button Type ]
push "Hii!"       		    [ Caption ]
push "Hii from Napster" [ Text ]
push 0                 		    [ Parent Window ]
call MessageBox

==The stack is reverse of the push,the stack grows from bottom up==.

--- Stack ---

0
Hii from Napster
Hii!
0

## # `Functions` -

Functions are chunks of code that performs a task or set of tasks.A function is a group of instructions that performs a specific task(ex. read/write files,send network data).A function has three basic components :

- Input (values passed in)
- Body (code to perform the task)
- Return (value passed back)

Calling a function involves a jump to another memory location.

### ## <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Control FLow</mark>

Calling a function involves two control transfers :

- Function format: return = function(arg0, arg1, ... )

- Specific events occurs when calling a function :
	- Pass in Parameters(stack/register).
	- Save the return pointer.
	- Transfer control to the function.

- Specific events occurs when returning from a function :
	- ==Set up a return value (typically EAX)==.
	- Clean up the stack and restore registers.
	- Transfer control to the saved return pointer.

### ## <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Prologue and Epilogue</mark>

Within a function, the prologue and epilogue performs setup and cleanup activities.Most functions contain a standard prologue and epilogue.

- The Prologue occurs at the start of function.
	- It allocates space for variables.
	- It saves registers that will be reused in the function body.

Example -

```c
push     ebp
mov      ebp, esp
sub      esp, 210h
```

1. The PUSH instruction saves EBP so that it can be used within this function as an unchanging reference.
2. Next, the MOV instruction places the value of ESP in EBP—from this point forward, ==EBP plus a value can refer to arguments and EBP minus a value can refer to variables==. This is the instruction that creates a new stack frame.
3. Lastly, the SUB instruction subtracts from ESP, creating room on the stack for variables. Subtracting from ESP is a common approach for ==allocating space for variables==, and the specific number subtracted will depend upon how much space is needed.

Another example -

```c
push         ebp
mov          ebp, esp
sub          esp, 54h
push         ebx
push         esi
push         edi
```

---

- Function Epilogue occurs at the end of a function.
	- It cleans up the stack(ex. POP allocated variables)
	- It restores registers.

Example -

```c
leave
retn
```

- leave = mov esp, ebp(effectively cleaning local variables)   +   pop ebp(restores EBP using the previous EBP value that was saved onto the stack (i.e., saved frame pointer))
- A retn performs pop eip, so execution jumps back to the caller.

Another Example -

```c
pop             edi
pop             esi
mov             al, bl
pop             ebx
leave
retn
```

## # `Stack` -

When a thread is running, it executes code from within the Program Image or from various Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). The thread requires a short-term data area for functions, local variables, and program control information, which is known as the stack. To facilitate the independent execution of multiple threads, each thread in a running application has its own stack. Stack memory is “viewed” by the CPU using a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure. This essentially means that while accessing the stack, items put (“pushed”) on the top of the stack are removed (“popped”) first. The x86 architecture implements dedicated PUSH and POP assembly instructions to add or remove data to the stack respectively.

- The stack is a section in memory used to store saved registers, local variables and function parameters.
- The stack is Last in First Out(LIFO).
- PUSH adds an element and POP removes one.
- ESP points to the next item on the stack and changes with instructions like PUSH, POP, CALL, LEAVE, RET.
- EBP(aka "Frame Pointer") serves as unchanging reference.
- ==EBP-value = local variable== (registers may also be used).
- ==EBP+value = parameter==.

### Example -

```
push             ebp                               [Save EBP]
mov              ebp, esp                          [Save ESP in EBP]
push             ecx                               [Allocate Space for Local Variable]
mov              eax, [ebp+8]                      [First Parameter passed into thr function]
add              eax, [ebp+0Ch]                    [Second Parameter passed into thr function]
add              eax, [ebp+10h]                    [Third Parameter passed into thr function]
mov              [ebp-4], eax
mov              eax, [ebp-4]                      [Set up reurn value]
mov              esp, ebp                          
pop              ebp                               [Restore EBP]
retn                                               [Return]
```

Lower memory addresses (for example, 0x00) are on the top, and higher memory addresses (for example, 0x4000) are on the bottom.

==EBP – value== (result is smaller address) ==(local variable)==

==EBP+value== (result is larger address) ==(argument)==

### <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Push vs mov</mark> -

- The push instruction subtracts 4 from ESP and places a value at that location.
- A MOV instruction can also place a value on the stack, but it does not subtract from ESP.

## # `Loops` -

Looping is used to execute a single code block many times.

The loop instruction (without a condition code) loops if ECX is not zero. All loop instructions have a maximum jump range of 128 bytes.All the loop commands automatically decrement the value of the ECX register.

Components of Loops -

- Control variable: This refers to the variable(s) that are used to determine if a loop exits. 
- Loop initialization: This is where the starting value for a loop control variable is assigned (usually found outside the loop body). 
- Loop body: This is the code block that gets executed. 
- Loop update: The instruction(s) that modifies the control variables during each loop iteration. 
- Stopping conditions: The conditions to determine if a loop should exit.

## # `64bit Assembly` -

- All general-purpose registers are expanded to 64 bits(e.g., EAX -> RAX, EBX -> RBX, ECX -> RCX).
- There are eight new general-purpose registers:R8 through R15.
- Special-use registers are extended and renamed (e.g., EIP -> RIP).
- RSP (not RBP) is often used to access parameters and variables.
- Calling convention resembles fastcall (parameters via registers).
	- ==First four parameters are passed in RCX, RDX, R8, R9.==
	- Additional parameters are stored on the stack


> When looking for arguments in 32-bit code, we often look for PUSH instructions above a CALL. This won't work with 64-bit code, because arguments are first passed into RCX, RDX, R8, and R9.
