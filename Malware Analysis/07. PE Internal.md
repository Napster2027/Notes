## # `EXE Entry Point Terminology` -

• <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">EntryPoint</mark> : The start of executable content specified in the `AddressOfEntryPoint` field in the `Optional Header`. 

• <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">WinMain</mark> :
	• The user-defined entry point for a graphical Windows application. 
	• If built with Visual Studio, ==WinMainCRTStartup== will call this function.
	• A different user-defined entry point can be specified using the ==/ENTRY== linker option 

• <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">main</mark> : 
	• The user-defined entry point for a C++ console application. 
	• If built with Visual Studio, ==mainCRTStartup== will call this function. 

• Code between the EntryPoint and WinMain/main is likely generated by the compiler.

## # `Calcualtion of Entry Point Address` -

The entry point of a binary file can be calculated using :

```c
Absolute entry point address = Base address + Entry point RVA
```

Base address and Entry Point RVA can be found by loading the binary into CFF Explorer(under Optional Header), PE Bear or any other PE parsing tool.

Example :

```c
Base address: 0x400000
Entry point RVA: 0x1000

Absolute entry point address = Base address + Entry point RVA = 0x400000 + 0x1000 = 0x401000
```

***RVA*** - RVA (Relative Virtual Address) is a way to represent the location of data or code within a file or executable. It is relative to the starting point of the section or module where it is located, and it is used to calculate the absolute address of the data or code during the runtime. RVA allows the executable to be loaded at any memory address without having to modify the actual address of the data or code.
