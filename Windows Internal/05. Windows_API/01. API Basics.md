# # `API` -

- Set of predefined Windows Functions used to control the appearance & behaviour of Windows Elements.
- Each & every user actions causes the execution of several API fuctions.
- Windows APIs resides in DLLs like `User32.dll`, `Kernel32.dll` present in `System 32` folder location.
- APIs in `.NET` are called through Platform Interop Services`(System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace)`.
- APIs can be used by binaries, DLLs etc to perform recon/elevate privileges etc in a target environment.
- Tools like Dependency Walker, DNSpy can be used to retrieve the DLLs & Functions a Windows module (exe, dll) calls during execution.

## `Important DLLs with API Functions` -

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Kernel32.dll</mark>	        ***Interact with Processes, Threads***

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">User32.dll</mark>		 ***Handle GUI, Peripherals etc***

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Shell32.dll</mark>		 ***Windows Shell***

- <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Netapi32.dll</mark>	       ***Networking Operations***

- ==Advapi.dll==	      ***Manage windows services, register etc***

- <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">NTDLL.dll</mark>           ***Exports the Windows Native API***


## # `Example` -

Many of the `Win32 APIs` are documented by Microsoft. One simple example is the `GetUserNameA` API exported by `Advapi32.dll` which retrieves the name of the user executing the function.

Function prototype for `GetUserNameA` -

```c++
BOOL GetUserNameA(
  [out]     LPSTR   lpBuffer,
  [in, out] LPDWORD pcbBuffer
);
```

[GetUserNameA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getusernamea)

In the above example, the API requires two arguments. The first is an output buffer of `type LPSTR` which is the Microsoft term for a `character array`. The second argument is a `pointer to a DWORD` which is a `32-bit unsigned integer`. The `return value` from the API is a `boolean`.

 ==Note== - 
 
Above shows the prototype for `GetUserNameA`, where the suffix “**A**” indicates the `ASCII` version of the API (**8-bit** Windows ANSI characters).

Below shows the prototype for `GetUserNameW`, in which the “**W**” suffix (for “wide char”) indicates `Unicode`:

```c++
BOOL GetUserNameW(
  [out]     LPWSTR  lpBuffer,
  [in, out] LPDWORD pcbBuffer
);
```

The first argument type is now of `type LPWSTR` which is a `UNICODE character array` (string of **16-bit** Unicode characters).

Unicode is the preferred character encoding on Windows.

Examlpe difference between ANSI(A) and Unicode/Wide(W) -

```c++
char str1[] = "maldev"; // 7 bytes (maldev + [null byte]).

wchar str2[] = L"maldev"; // 14 bytes, each character is 2 bytes (The null byte is also 2 bytes)
```

The Windows API has many data types outside of the well-known ones (e.g. int, float). The data types are documented and can be viewed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types).

## # `Extended Version of an API` -

- Some APIs have an extended version.
- Eg, VirtualAllocEx is the extended version of VirtualAlloc.
- They are used to allocate virtual memory.
- VirtualAlloc allocates virtual memory for the current running process.
- But VirtualAllocEx allocates virtual memory for `other` running processes

Different version of Api Calls :

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Character**|**Explanation**|
|<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A</mark>|Represents an 8-bit character set with ANSI encoding|
|<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">W</mark>|Represents a Unicode encoding|
|<mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Ex</mark>|Provides extended functionality or in/out parameters to the API call|

## # `Native (NT) Version of the APIs` -

- Another version of API are called NT which is provided by ntdll.dll example NTCreateFile.
- It is much low-level because it is closer to the kernel.
- Ntdll.dll then uses system calls (SYSCALLS) to execute the task.
- SYSCALLS are kernel level functions.
- Kernel Level functions is the heart of the Operating System.
- User Level functions (APIs) make use of Kernel Level functions.
- NT APIs in ntdll.dll are not officially documented by Microsoft but reverse engineers have done some work -

[Undocumentes NTApi](http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/)

Most of the Native API calls are implemented in `ntoskrnl.exe` (the Windows kernel image) and exposed to user mode via `ntdll.dll`. These APIs are not strictly designed to be called directly from user applications, and as such are not as accessible as the WinAPIs.  The higher-level WinAPIs actually call these Native APIs in the background.  For example, ==OpenProcess in kernel32.dll calls NtOpenProcess in ntdll.dll==

## # `Calling windows Api` -

Each API call of the Win32 library resides in memory and requires a pointer to a memory address. The process of obtaining pointers to these functions is obscured because of ==**ASLR** (**A**ddress **S**pace **L**ayout **R**andomization)== implementations; each language or package has a unique procedure to overcome ASLR.The two most popular implementations are :

-  <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Windows Header File</mark> : Microsoft has released the Windows header file, also known as the Windows loader, as a direct solution to the problems associated with ASLR’s implementation. Keeping the concept at a high level, at runtime, the loader will determine what calls are being made and create a thunk table to obtain function addresses or pointers.

  Once the `windows.h` file is included at the top of an unmanaged program; any Win32 function can be called.

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">P/Invoke</mark> : Microsoft describes P/Invoke or platform invoke as “a technology that allows you to access structs, callbacks, and functions in unmanaged libraries from your managed code.”P/invoke provides tools to handle the entire process of invoking an unmanaged function from managed code or, in other words, calling the Win32 API. P/invoke will kick off by importing the desired DLL that contains the unmanaged function or Win32 API call.
