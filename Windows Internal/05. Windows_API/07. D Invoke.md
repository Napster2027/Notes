## # `Dynamic invoke(D/Invoke)` -

Dynamic Invoke ([D/Invoke](https://github.com/TheWover/DInvoke)) is an open-source C# project intended as a direct replacement for P/Invoke.  It has a number of powerful primitives that can be combined to do some really neat things, including:

-   Invoke unmanaged code without P/Invoke.
-   Manually map unmanaged PE's into memory and call their associated entry point or an exported function.
-   Generate syscall wrappers for native APIs.

**Why avoid P/Invoke?**

1. 1. Any reference to a Windows API call made through P/Invoke will result in a corresponding entry in the .NET Assembly’s Import Table. When your .NET Assembly is loaded, its Import Address Table will be updated with the addresses of the functions that you are calling.
2. If the endpoint security product running on the target machine is monitoring API calls (such as via API Hooking), then any calls made via P/Invoke may be detected by the product.


Tools such as [pestudio](https://www.winitor.com/) can inspect a compiled .NET assembly and identify "suspicious" P/Invoke usage.  In the example below, this assembly calls OpenProcess, VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread.  These APIs are synonymous with process injection and would therefore raise some alarms.
