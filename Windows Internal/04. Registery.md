## # `Registery` -

The registry is effectively a database that consists of a massive number of keys with associated values. These keys are sorted hierarchically using subkeys.

At the root, multiple registry hives contain logical divisions of registry keys. ==Information related to the current user is stored in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) hive==, while ==information related to the operating system itself is stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) hive==.

	Note: The HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive is writable by the current user while modification of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE      hive requires administrative privileges.
