==NTDLL.DLL act as a bridge between user land and kernel land==.

In the above Nt Readfile is called and a value of 8A (hex) is moved into the eax and then sysenter or syscall is invoked and the execution goes to kernel land the execution is done in the kernel land and reult is returned back in user land.

In the above you can see the syscall number is 6.The syscall number differs from OS to OS.
