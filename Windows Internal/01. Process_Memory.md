## # `Process Memory` -

Memory is allocated to a process when it is created and the amount that is allocated can be set by the process itself. The operating system manages memory using both virtual and physical memory. Virtual memory allows the operating system to use more memory than what is physically available by creating a virtual address space that can be accessed by the applications. These virtual address spaces are divided into "pages" which are then allocated to processes.

## # `Virtual Memory` -

Computer systems have limited RAM, yet we are able to execute programs, processes, which takes up huge amounts of memory, that is made possible due to something called Virtual Memory.

	Virtual Memory allows a computer program to have huge amounts of memory beyond the RAM's actual memory is.

Example -

![[Pasted image 20230131124538.png]]

The above diagram shows how a computer program executes.Execution involves three main components - CPU, RAM & Hard disk.

Program is stored on the Hard disk, but for the CPU to be able to execute any instructions on the program, the operating system first loads the program into ram memory and creates a process, the CPU then reads the instructions from RAM and executes those instructions.

Virtual Memory is created to expand the availabe RAM.Virtual Memory creates an illusion to a process that there is huge amount of RAM available exclusively for any process to use.

![[Pasted image 20230131130005.png]]

In the above diagram you can see that the actual RAM could be just 1 GB, but because of virtualization or virtual memory a process can access to four gigabytes or even more for a 64 bit operating system.Multiple process can be running almost in parallel, and each of them can be promised up to four gigabytes, even though the actual physical room is only one gigabyte and they can execute in parallel without interference from each other.

	HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE??

==This is possible because Hard Disk is used as Virtual Memory.==So Hard Disk combined with actual physical memory creates the ability to create virtual memory.

Example -

![[Pasted image 20230131130912.png]]

In the above figure, we have two process - Process 1 and Process 2.

Process one may have two pages(pages are just a chunk or block of memory).So assuming process one takes up two pages in the physical memory.

	Memory is managed in chunks called Pages default is 4kb

But then comes process two who needs to use one page.

The Operating System will swap page two(of Processs 1) from the physical memory to the hard disk.So Page 2, which belongs to Process one, is still in virtual memory, but swapped out to the Hard disk.This is done so that process 2 can load its page into physical memory and finish its execution and when process 2 finishes its execution page 2(of process 1) will be swapped back to physical memory and will resume its execution.The swapping of memory between hard disk and physical memory is done so fast and seamlessly that the user does not notice this.

### <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Page State</mark> -

The pages residing within a process's virtual address space can be in one of 3 states:

1. **<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Free</mark>** - The page is neither committed nor reserved. The page is not accessible to the process. It is available to be reserved, committed, or simultaneously reserved and committed. Attempting to read from or write to a free page can result in an access violation exception.

2. **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Reserved</mark>** - The page has been reserved for future use. The range of addresses cannot be used by other allocation functions. The page is not accessible and has no physical storage associated with it. It is available to be committed.

3. **<mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Committed</mark>** - Memory charges have been allocated from the overall size of RAM and paging files on disk. The page is accessible and access is controlled by one of the memory protection constants. The system initializes and loads each committed page into physical memory only during the first attempt to read or write to that page. When the process terminates, the system releases the storage for committed pages.

---

### <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Page Protection Options</mark>

Once the pages are committed, they need to have their protection option set. The list of memory protection constants can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/memory-protection-constants) but some examples are listed below.

- `PAGE_NOACCESS` - Disables all access to the committed region of pages. An attempt to read from, write to or execute the committed region will result in an access violation.

- `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` - Enables Read, Write and Execute. ==This is highly discouraged from being used and is generally an IoC because it's uncommon for memory to be both writable and executable at the same time==.

- `PAGE_READONLY` - Enables read-only access to the committed region of pages. An attempt to write to the committed region results in an access violation.

---

### <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Memory Protection</mark> -

Modern operating systems generally have built-in memory protections to thwart exploits and attacks. These are also important to keep in mind as they will likely be encountered when building or debugging the malware.

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Data Execution Prevention (DEP)</mark> - DEP is a system-level memory protection feature that is built into the operating system starting with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. If the page protection option is set to PAGE_READONLY, then DEP will prevent code from executing in that memory region.

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Address space layout randomization (ASLR)</mark> - ASLR is a memory protection technique used to prevent the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. ==ASLR randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap and libraries==.

#### <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">Memory Types</mark> -

Processes can have different types of memory :

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Private memory</mark> is dedicated to a single process and cannot be shared by other processes. This type of memory is used to store data that is specific to the process.

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Mapped memory</mark> can be shared between two or more processes. It is used to share data between processes, such as shared libraries, shared memory segments, and shared files. Mapped memory is visible to other processes, but is protected from being modified by other processes.

- <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Image memory</mark> contains the code and data of an executable file. It is used to store the code and data that is used by the process, such as the program's code, data, and resources. Image memory is often related to DLL files loaded into a process's address space.

### <mark style="background: #3D7EFFA6;">x86 vs x64 Memory Space</mark> -

When working with Windows processes, it's important to note whether the process is x86 or x64. ==x86 processes have a smaller memory space of 4GB== (`0xFFFFFFFF`) whereas ==x64 has a vastly larger memory space of 128TB== (`0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`).

Generally its 50-50 i.e half of the memory space is for user mode and half for Kernel mode.

> 0x0 - 0x77777777 : `User Mode` [2GB]

> 0x77777777 - 0xffffffff : `Kernel Mode` [2GB]

## # `Address Translation` -

In the context of a Windows operating system, memory space in user mode refers to a portion of the computer's memory that is allocated for use by user-level processes and applications.Here are key points about memory space in user mode:

1. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Memory Protection Modes</mark> :

- Modern operating systems like Windows use a memory protection mechanism to separate the memory used by the operating system (kernel mode) from the memory used by user-level processes (user mode).

- ==User mode and kernel mode are distinct and isolated memory spaces==.


2. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">User-Mode Processes</mark> :

- User-mode processes include all user-level applications and programs running on the system, such as web browsers, word processors, games, and more.

- Each user-mode process typically has its own isolated memory space. This isolation is enforced by the operating system to prevent one process from accessing or corrupting the memory of another process.


3. <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">Virtual Memory</mark> :

- ==Memory in user mode is often managed as virtual memory==, which allows processes to have the illusion of a large, contiguous memory space, even if physical RAM is limited.

- Virtual memory addresses used by processes are translated to physical addresses by the operating system's memory management unit (MMU).


4. <mark style="background: #07E997A6;">Memory Allocation and Deallocation</mark> :

- User-mode processes request memory allocation for data structures, variables, and program code using functions like `malloc` (in C/C++), `new` (in C++), or memory allocation APIs provided by the operating system.

- When memory is no longer needed, user-mode processes can deallocate it using functions like `free` (in C/C++) or other memory deallocation methods.


5. <mark style="background: #FF5582;">Security and Isolation</mark> :

- Memory in user mode is protected and isolated to ensure the security and stability of the system. Processes cannot directly access kernel-mode memory or modify critical system data structures.


6. <mark style="background: #07E2E96E;">Page Tables</mark> :

- To facilitate address translation, ==the operating system uses data structures called page tables==. Each process has its own page table.

- ==The page table maps virtual addresses to physical addresses==. It records which parts of the process's virtual address space are currently located in physical memory and where they are stored.


7. <mark style="background: #FF9255;">Address Translation Process</mark> :

==Address Translation is done by the CPU==.The Address Translation Process works as follows -

A.  <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Virtual Address Generation</mark> :

- A process generates a virtual memory address when accessing memory. For example, when reading from or writing to a variable.


B. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Page Table Lookup</mark> :

- The CPU, when executing instructions, generates a virtual address. It sends this address to the Memory Management Unit (MMU).


C. <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">MMU Lookup</mark> :

==The MMU==, which is a hardware component, ==takes the virtual address and looks up the corresponding entry in the process's page table==.


D. <mark style="background: #07E997A6;">Page Table Entry</mark> :

- The page table entry ==contains information about the virtual-to-physical address mapping==.

- If the virtual page is in physical memory (a "hit"), the page table entry provides the physical address directly.

- If it's not in physical memory or ==if a user-mode process attempts an invalid memory operation== (e.g., accessing a memory address it doesn't have permission to access), ==the operating system typically generates an exception, such as an access violation== (e.g., "Access Violation at Address..." or a "miss"), this triggers a page fault.


8. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Page Fault Handling</mark> :

How does Page Handling works -

A. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Page Fault Exception</mark> :

- A page fault exception is raised when a program or process tries to access a page of virtual memory that is currently not in physical memory (RAM). This could happen when a program attempts to read from or write to a memory location that has been paged out to disk. This ==page fault is a context switch from user mode to kernel mode==.


B. <mark style="background: #E632B3A6;">First Chance Exception</mark> :

- ==When a page fault occurs, the operating system's memory manager intercepts it. At this point, the exception is considered a "first chance exception"==.

- The operating system has the opportunity to handle the page fault and take appropriate actions to resolve it. These actions typically involve bringing the required page of memory from disk into physical memory (if available) or handling the error condition if the page cannot be retrieved.


C. <mark style="background: #07E997A6;">Exception Handling</mark> :

- If the operating system successfully resolves the page fault (e.g., by bringing the required page into physical memory), the program can continue executing without necessarily being aware that an exception occurred.

- However, ==if the page fault cannot be resolved== (e.g., due to a missing page on disk or access violation), ==the operating system may terminate the offending program or raise a second chance exception, which can lead to application termination== or other error handling actions.

Above we are trying to dump the zero'th address but we are getting bunch of `?`. That means there is a failure in the translation of the pages that is there is no valid `Page Table` entry for the particular page .So if the application trying to acess any of the above address it will get an `Access Violation` or there will be a `Page Fault`.
